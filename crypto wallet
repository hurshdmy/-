# Crypto Wallet Generator

A simple Python script to generate Bitcoin wallets using the `bitcoinlib` library.

## How It Works
This script creates a Bitcoin wallet and displays the wallet address and private key. It is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used to store real funds without additional security measures.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `bitcoinlib` library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-wallet-generator.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install bitcoinlib
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python wallet_generator.py
    ```
4. Save the private key securely to avoid losing access to your wallet.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Include an option to encrypt the private key.
- Display QR codes for wallet addresses.
